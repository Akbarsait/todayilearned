Mapping and accessing a network drive is a must needed one for me in Mac to access the data in windows network. The quicker way to do is using the Command + K key combination in Finder.

In Finder,hit Command+K to bring up “Connect to Server” or click Go > Connect to Server.
Enter the network path you’re trying to map (e.g. smb://mydrivepath/compnetwork/) and click Connect.
Enter login credentials and click OK to mount the network drive.
